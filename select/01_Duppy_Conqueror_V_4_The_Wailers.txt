Yes, mi friend، mi good friend
Dem say we're free again

The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me now
They try to keep me down, yeah

And wrongly abused now
But through the powers of the Most High
They've got to turn me loose, oh, oh, oh

So if you a bull-bucker, let me tell you this
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror
