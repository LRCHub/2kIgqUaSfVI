Oh, oh, op-bo, bo, bo-bo-bo
Oh, oh, op-bo, bo, bo-bo-bo

Yes, mi friend, mi friend
Them set me free again
Yes, mi friend, mi friend
Me deh 'pon street again
The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me now

They try to keep me down
But God put me around
Yes, I've been accused
Wrongly abused, now
But through the powers of the most-high
They got to turn me loose, hmm

Don't try to cold me up
On this bridge now
I've got to reach Mount Zion
The highest region
If you a bull-bucker
Let me tell you that
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

Yes, mi friend, mi good friend
Them set me free again, mm
Yes, mi friend
Them turn me loose again

Don't try to cold me up
On this bridge now
I've got to reach Mount Zion
The highest region
If you a bull-bucker
Let me tell you
I'm a duppy conqueror
Hit it (conqueror)

Yes, mi friend, mi friend, mi friend, mi friend
We deh a street again
Yes, mi friend, mi friend, mi friend
Dem set me free again

Don't try to show off
Fi make you friend dem laugh, what a la-la
For I will cut you off
And I will take the last straw
I'm cryin'

Yes, mi friend
We deh a street again, yea-eah
Yes, mi friend, mi friend, mi friend
