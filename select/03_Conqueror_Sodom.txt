Company of Heaven sent us a chosen apostle to the treasure of the damned
Blessing no longer be poured the mystical lord covered with rich headdress
He will proceed his way over the line, furious as tiger
Once the tower cracked beneath its lash, caught inextinguishable fire

The lord of host gave ear into his song, intolerable blackness helms him
Only the lightning from his hand that sits when usurping tyrants fall
An unsullied maid baffles his seductions and his ire, pines in the prison
Compassion is the vice of kings, stamp down the wretched weak

Conqueror
Conqueror
Conqueror, hey!

You are not of the slaves that perish, pity 'em not
Tear down that lying spectre of centuries, vices in virtuous words
We'll hide in a smash of sorrow, you shall fear
Let your rites be rightly performed with joy and beauty

Conqueror
Conqueror
Conqueror, hey!
