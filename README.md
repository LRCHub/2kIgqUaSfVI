```
Conqueror,
Conqueror
I'm taking the start
as I open the book
Don't care if it's a draft
I make my own rules
I'm an Untouchable target,
cause I'm way far from you
I'm an unstoppable rocket
going straight to the moon
I'm taking my chance cause
life may be cruel
I'm no guilty for it
and I got nothing to lose
Baby will you follow me
for a ride in exstasy? Oh
Baby will you follow me
for a ride in exstasy? Oh
Conqueror,
Conqueror
Conqueror,
Conqueror
Conqueror,
Conqueror
Conqueror,
Conqueror
How is it bad to
charge at the light?
I got no brakes
and I fuck all my doubts
I'm an Untouchable target,
cause I'm way far from you
I'm an unstoppable rocket
flying straight to the moon
I'm taking my chance cause
life may be cruel
I'm no guilty for it
and I got nothing to lose
Baby will you follow me
for a ride in ecstasy? Oh
Baby will you follow me
for a ride in ecstasy? Oh
Conqueror,
Conqueror
Conqueror,
Conqueror
Conqueror,
Conqueror
Conqueror,
Conqueror
If you feel the same just let go
Open your heart to a new soul
If you wait the day
you'll be a hero
just start it now,
forget the zero
Conqueror,
Conqueror
Conqueror,
Conqueror
Conqueror,
Conqueror
Conqueror,
Conqueror
